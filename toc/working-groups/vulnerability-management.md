# Vulnerability Management: Working Group Charter

## Mission

Provides discreet management of security vulnerabilities issues relevant for active CF projects.

## Goals

* Provide a single point of contact for security vulnerability reporting and management.
* Provide management of security vulnerability reports through to resolution, including but not limited to triage, reporter and team coordination, embargo negotiation, CVSS scoring, CVE assignments, pre-disclosure and disclosure.

## Scope

* Triage incoming security vulnerability reports to [security@cloudfoundry.org](mailto:security@cloudfoundry.org).
* Manage vulnerabilities through dedicated slack channels.
* When appropriate, negotiate suitable embargo periods with the reporter to afford component teams time to fix the issue before it becomes known publicly.
* When appropriate, assign CVE numbers to vulnerabilities/fixes.
* Publish pre-disclosures to allow all CF distributions time to adopt fixes for high/critical vulnerabilities before they become known publicly.
* Publish disclosures of reported security vulnerabilities.

## Non-Goals

* Add security-related features to Cloud Foundry projects.
