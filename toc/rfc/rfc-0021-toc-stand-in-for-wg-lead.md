## Summary

Working Group Leads are in charge of approving and merging PRs for their
Working Group. When the TOC decideds it is necessary, the TOC MAY make decisions in their place.

## Problem

Sometimes Working Group Leads go on vacation or get sick and are not available
to take actions for their working group. This can cause work in the working group to be blocked until
the Working Group Lead returns.

## Proposal

When the TOC decides it is necessary, the TOC MAY make decisions in their stead. This
includes approving and merging PRs for their Working Group. All actions MUST
have the approval of a majority of the TOC members.
