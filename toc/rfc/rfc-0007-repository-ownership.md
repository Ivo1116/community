- Name: Working Group Repository Ownership

- Status: Accepted
- RFC Pull Request: [community#251](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/community/pull/251)


## Summary

Adding a repository to the ownership scope of a Working Group, removing a
repository from its scope, or transferring a repository between Working Groups
requires approval separately from each affected Working Group and from the
Technical Oversight Committee (TOC).


## Problem

As the CF community completes its rollout of the new TOC and Working Group
governance structure, the large number of unaddressed PRs about repository
ownership across Working Groups has illustrated that the community needs a
clearer and more consistent process to handle such ownership changes. In
particular, there are currently a significant number of repositories in the
[`cloudfoundry`](https://github.com/cloudfoundry) and
[`cloudfoundry-incubator`](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator) GitHub
organizations that are not yet officially assigned to a Working Group, and the
community must decide which ones will be managed by which Working Groups and
which ones will be archived.

Even after the CF community resolves the ownership of the existing repositories
in these two GitHub organizations, it still needs a clear process to create new
repositories under a Working Group, to move repositories between Working
Groups, and to remove a repository from a Working Group.


## Proposal

### Ownership model

We can represent the ownership structure of the repositories in CFF Managed
Github Orgs as a partition of the set of repositories. Each Working Group has a
subset of repositories that it owns, and there are separate subsets under
ownership of the TOC and of the CF Foundation staff, respectively. Finally,
there are two separate subsets of unmanaged repositories: ones that are
archived and ones that are active. Since this collection of subsets is a
partition, the subsets MUST be mutually exclusive and comprehensively
exhaustive: each repository in a CFF Managed Github Org is in exactly one of
these subsets.

The subset of repositories that each Working Group owns MUST be identical to
the set of repositories listed in its charter description. This set of
repositories MAY further be partitioned into technical areas within the Working
Group, at the discretion of the Working Group.

The subsets of repositories that the TOC and the CF Foundation staff own SHOULD
be as small as possible and should be scoped to those that enable the effective
operation of the CF community. These repostiories SHOULD NOT be concerned with
development of tools and systems that are broadly valuable to the end-user
community, as the Working Groups collectively SHOULD own those kinds of
repositories instead. These two sets of repositories MUST be listed in the
charter document for the TOC in this repository.

The subset of unmanaged active repositories SHOULD be empty under steady-state
operation. The community MUST collectively act to resolve the status of an
unmanaged active repository within a reasonable period of time, either by
archiving it or by placing it under the ownership of a  Working Group, of the
TOC, or of the CFF staff, as is appropriate.

The ownership structure of the repositories in the `cloudfoundry-incubator`
GitHub organization can be described the same way as a partition of the set of
repositories amongst the Working Groups. Since incubation is no longer a
relevant concept in CF Foundation governance, the community SHOULD act to move
all of the active repositories in this organization to the main `cloudfoundry`
GitHub organization in a reasonable period of time, while coordinating with the
Working Groups to minimize negative effects on development and release
practices. The community MUST NOT create new repositories in the
`cloudfoundry-incubator` GitHub organization and MUST NOT move any existing
repositories into it.


### Ownership changes

A change to repository ownership is a change to the partition of the set of
repositories in CFF Managed Github Organization. For a single repository, the
possible changes are the addition of a new repository to the one of the subsets
in the partition, the transfer of an existing repository from one subset to
another, or the removal of a repository from a subset.

Addition of a repository to the partition corresponds either to creating a new
repository, transferring an existing repository from another GitHub
organization, or adding an additional Github Organization to the list of CFF
Managed Github Organizations.

Removal of a repository corresponds either to transferring it to a non-CFF
Managed GitHub Organization or to deleting the repository entirely, neither of
which should be undertaken lightly. The CF community SHOULD ensure that either
of these cases receives thorough consideration and scrutiny before proceeding.

Proposed changes to repository ownership SHOULD be submitted for consideration
as a pull request on the [Cloud Foundry community
repository](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/community) that modifies the
charter documents of the appropriate Working Groups. As per [RFC
0003](rfc-0003-pr-only-workflow.md), a pull request is preferable in order to
provide visibility in the CF community, to encourage asynchronous discussion
across time zones, and to reduce fragmentation of discussion.


### Ownership change approvals

The TOC MUST approve any change to repository ownership, just as it originally
approved the initial set of repositories for each Working Group. Approval
consists of a quorum decision by the TOC.

Additionally, if a change affects the subset of repositories that a Working
Group owns, that Working Group MUST approve the change as well. Approval
consists of a quorum decision by the leads of the Working Group.

The TOC MUST also approve of any proposal to create a new repository within a
CFF Managed Github Organization or to rename an existing repository. 

We illustrate several different cases of repository ownership changes and the
approvals required for them to proceed:

#### Case 1: A Working Group wants to create a new repository under their ownership.

Approval requirements
* The Working Group MUST approve the addition of the proposed repository to the
  set of repositories that it owns.
* The TOC MUST approve the creation of the proposed repository.
* The TOC MUST approve the addition of the proposed repository to the Working
  Group's subset.

Steps
1. Someone opens a PR that: adds the repo to the
   [cloudfoundry.yml](../../org/cloudfoundry.yml) and adds the repo to the
   desired Working Group's yaml.
2. The Working Group and TOC both approve the PR.
3. The TOC merges the PR.

#### Case 2: The TOC wants Working Group A to take ownership of an unclaimed active repository.

Approval requirements
* The TOC MUST approve the change in the ownership scope of Working Group A.
* Working Group A MUST approve the change to the set of repositories they own.

Steps
1. Someone opens a PRs that adds a repo to the desired Working Group's yaml.
2. The Working Group and TOC both approve the PR.
3. The TOC merges the PR.


#### Case 3: Working Group A wants to claim ownership of a repository currently owned by Working Group B.

Approval requirements
* Both Working Group A and Working Group B MUST approve the change to the sets
  of repositories they own.
* The TOC MUST also approve the transfer of the repository from Working Group B
  to Working Group A.

Steps
1. Someone opens a PR that moves a repo from Working Group A's yaml to Working
   Group B's yaml.
2. Working Group A, Working Group B, and TOC approve the PR.
3. The TOC merges the PR.

#### Case 4: A Working Group wants to archive a repository that it currently owns.

Approval requirements
* The Working Group MUST approve the removal of the repository from the set of
  repositories that it owns.
* The TOC MUST approve the removal of the repository from the Working Group and
  the archival.

Steps
1. Someone opens a PR that: marks the repo as archived in the
   [cloudfoundry.yml](../../org/cloudfoundry.yml) and that removes the repo from
   the Working Group's yaml.
2. The Working Group and TOC both approve the PR.
3. The TOC merges the PR.

#### Case 5: A Working Group wants to delete a repository that it currently owns.
⚠️ Deleting a repository will usually be rejected by the TOC. Please consider
archiving instead.

Approval requirements
* The Working Group MUST approve the removal of the repository from the set of
  repositories that it owns.
* The TOC MUST approve the removal of the repository from the Working Group and
  the deletion.

Steps
1. Someone opens a PR that removes the
   [cloudfoundry.yml](../../org/cloudfoundry.yml) and removes the repo from the
   Working Group's yaml.
2. The Working Group and TOC both approve the PR.
3. The TOC merges the PR.
4. A github admin deletes the repo.

#### Case 6: A Working Group wants to cease maintaining a repository that it currently owns.

Approval requirements
* The Working Group MUST approve the removal of the repository from the set of
  repositories that it owns.
* The TOC MUST approve the removal of the repository from the Working Group.
* In addition, the TOC MUST decide whether to archive the repository or to
  arrange for another Working Group to own it instead (possibly a newly formed
  one, if appropriate and if supported by community contributors).
* Note: In this case, it is unlikely that either the TOC or the CFF staff
  should own this repository, as it was already owned by some Working Group in
  the CF community.


Steps
1. Someone opens a PR that removes the repo from the Working Group's yaml.
2. The TOC reviews and decides what action to take with the repo. Other PRs
   might be required for this step.
3. The Working Group and TOC both approve the PR.
5. The TOC merges the PR.

#### Case 7: A Working Group wants to rename a repository that it currently owns.

Approval requirements
* The Working Group A and the TOC MUST both approve of the new name for the
  repository.

Steps
1. Someone opens a PR that: renames the repo in the
   [cloudfoundry.yml](../../org/cloudfoundry.yml) and renames the repo in the
   Working Group's yaml.
2. The Working Group and TOC both approve the PR.
3. The TOC stops the Github automation.
4. The TOC merges the PR.
5. The TOC renames the repo using the Github UI.
6. The TOC re-enables the Github automation.
