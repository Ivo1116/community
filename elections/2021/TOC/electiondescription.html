<h1>2021 Cloud Foundry Foundation Technical Oversight Committee Election</h1>

<p>The CFF's Technical Oversight Committee (TOC) is responsible for the oversight, direction, and delivery of technical aspects of the Cloud Foundry projects and working groups.</p>

<p>The TOC is established by the CFF's Governing Board, who is responsible (amongst other things) for establishing the responsibilities of the TOC, how it is formed and the policies it operates under. The Governing Board's definition of the TOC can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/community/blob/main/governing-board/charter.md">CFF's charter</a>.</p>

<p>This election will use a time-limited Condorcet ranking on CIVS using the Schulze method, and will be closed on June 15.</p>

<h1>Candidate Nomination Statements</h1>

<p>The following are the nomination statements from (or for) each candidate, listed in the order in which the nominations were received.</p>

<h2>Candidate Name: Eric Malm</h2>

<p>Affiliation: VMware</p>

<p>Nomination Statement: I have considered it a tremendous privilege to build great software with the CF community over the past 7+ years, and I look forward to helping to make our community healthier and more diverse on top of more transparent, inclusive, and fair processes. I'm excited about the opportunities we have both to continue investment in the powerful systems we have built on top of BOSH and the CF App Runtime and to extend the value proposition of CF deeply into the Kubernetes community.</p>

<p>I have contributed significantly to the community discussions to define the TOC and working group roles over the past six months, in addition to carrying out my role as the App Runtime PMC lead in the previous governance structure. I also have broad knowledge across many CF projects, including not only the CF App Runtime but also BOSH, OSBAPI, and Paketo buildpacks, and would appreciate the chance to employ that context in service of our community.</p>

<h2>Candidate Name: Andrew Edgar</h2>

<p>Affiliation: IBM</p>

<p>Nomination Statement: Andrew has worked with Cloud Foundry (CF) for a long time, especially as a core contributor on the Diego development team as it became the default runtime. In the past 8 years working on the IBM Public CF implementation, he has a wealth of hands-on experience of both customers using CF and the challenges and experience running a large CF installation. He has developed and submitted many PRs in a wide variety of projects to improve how CF works and how it's managed and run. He also was one of the first members of the Eirini development team as it began its incubation. Recently he has been working on how to migrate IBMs large public VM based installation into a deployment based on Kubecf. This development project involves working with the quarks and Kubecf teams testing, validating and submitting improvements to enable Kubecf to work in a large multi-tenant environment as well as designing how to enable a hybrid solution where migration from VMs can be done with zero downtime. Andrew's main goal is to see Cloud Foundry continue to drive the user experience into Kubernetes.</p>

<h2>Candidate Name: David Stevenson</h2>

<p>Affiliation: VMware</p>

<p>Nomination Statement: David Stevenson has been involved with the CF community since 2013. Long ago he architected the V2 services API (which eventually became known as OSBAPI) and did extensive cloud controller contributions. He also loves BOSH, contributing to the director itself and 3 different CPIs. Finally he has deep certificate, credential, and authentication expertise with the ability to contribute to UAA and Credhub. If you ever have a question about how some part of CF works, he’ll almost certainly have an answer. David is excited about expanding his collaboration with the community and building out a better multi-vendor healthy open source community for cloud foundry going forward!</p>

<h2>Candidate Name: Beyhan Veli</h2>

<p>Affiliation: SAP</p>

<p>Nomination Statement: Beyhan has been active in the Cloud Foundry community for the past 6+ years. He started as a contributor to Cloud Foundry as member of the BOSH team at SAP. Over time, he created 80+ pull requests and supported many more that the team initiated.</p>

<p>His focus areas have been BOSH in general, BOSH DNS, BOSH monitoring, the BOSH command line interface, and bosh-deployment. Additionally, he actively helped people via the community BOSH slack channel and gave sessions about BOSH at CF Summit and CF Operators SIG . E.g. in 2020, he did a CF summit session titled "A Journey Through BOSH and BOSH DNS Monitoring" (https://sched.co/fDVn, https://youtu.be/jpnMKWKFhT0).</p>

<p>More recently, Beyhan has taken on a broader role and is now also looking into other areas of Cloud Foundry like the Cloud Controller and general topics from a Cloud Foundry developer experience perspective.</p>

<p>Currently, Beyhan is a co-chair for the CF Summit 2021 "Behind the Curtain" track.</p>

<h2>Candidate Name: Jan von Loewenstein</h2>

<p>Affiliation: SAP</p>

<p>Nomination Statement: Jan has been active in the Cloud Foundry community for the past 6+ years. He started as a contributor to Cloud Foundry as member of the BOSH team at SAP. Over time, he authored 30+ pull requests and helped in working on many more done by the SAP BOSH team.</p>

<p>When Cloud Foundry on Kubernetes became a thing, Jan built a prototypical BOSH CPI for Kubernetes (https://youtu.be/xGwwyut-Yoo, https://github.com/SAP/bosh-kubernetes-cpi-release). Additionally, he worked with the kubecf team, the Eirini team and later the cf-for-k8s teams. Most recently, he has taken on a broader role at SAP which extended his areas of focus also to the topic of Cloud Foundry application staging and buildpacks.</p>

<p>In the last months, Jan was an active part of the cross-company team that defined the new Cloud Foundry contribution guidelines in this repository which eventually led to this first TOC election.</p>

<h2>Candidate Name: Stephan Merker</h2>

<p>Affiliation: SAP</p>

<p>Nomination Statement: Stephan has been active in the Cloud Foundry community for the past 6+ years. He is very active in Github issues, Slack conversations and has been contributing pull requests to Cloud Foundry.</p>

<p>He has been looking into and trouble-shooting issues with Cloud Foundry at scale in areas like Cloud Controller/CAPI, Diego, Loggregator, observability and monitoring of both Cloud Foundry itself as well as Cloud Foundry applications, cf-deployment, blobstore integration, Concourse, documentation and many more.</p>

<p>With his broad areas of expertise, Stephan is probably one of the people who has the broadest view on how Cloud Foundry is operated and being used by developers productively as he is the product owner of one of the SAP teams responsible for operating some of the biggest Cloud Foundry deployments world-wide on a broad set of IaaS infrastructures.</p>

<h2>Candidate Name: Daniel Vaughan</h2>

<p>Affiliation: HCL</p>

<p>Nomination Statement: I would like to nominate Daniel Vaughan from HCL. Dan is based in our London Lab and is our CF development lead. He is the project leader for our KubeCF implementation and is responsible for our CF-4-K8s alignment too. He led engineering for the new CFMR on OpenShift (this is the product we created for IBM). IBM have recently asked us to contribute to Eirini and Dan is leading that effort too.</p>

<p>He is both CFCD and CKAD. If TOC wants someone who is firmly aligned with where we need to drive CF, then I don’t think we would find anyone stronger than Dan.</p>

<h2>Candidate Name: Lee Porte</h2>

<p>Affiliation: GOV.UK PaaS</p>

<p>Nomination Statement: I’d like to nominate Lee Porte of the GOV.UK Paas team. Lee has been actively engaged with the other teams that run CF in the public sector in the US, and Australia. The TOC should have representation that includes the teams that need to place a high emphasis on the compliance needs for themselves and their tenants, and ensure that CF grows in a way that reduces the ongoing operational burden on lean publicly-funded operations staff.</p>
