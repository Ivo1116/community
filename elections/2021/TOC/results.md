# 2021 CFF Technical Oversight Committee Election Results

Many thanks to everyone who took the time to register and vote in the first Cloud Foundry Foundation annual election for our newly forming Technical Oversight Committee (TOC). I also extend my deep thanks to all of the nominees who agreed to run in the election. Overall, our community’s participation in this election process was outstanding (especially given that this was our first time doing this!)

And with that preamble, I’m pleased to announce our first CFF Technical Oversight Committee will be:

* Eric Malm (VMware)
* David Stevenson (VMware)
* Jan von Loewenstein (SAP)
* Stephan Merker (SAP)
* Lee Porte (GOV.UK)

Congratulations to Eric, David, Jan, Stephan and Lee! I’m looking forward to working with you to get the TOC up and running.

## Details

One of the [primary principles](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/community/blob/main/toc/PRINCIPLES.md) that our technical governance process is based on is transparency. That applies to the election process and results themselves, with the only exception being that ballot records are anonymous. 

With that in mind, here are the election details:

Election Supervisor: Chip Childers

Announced end of poll: June 15, 2021

Actual time poll closed: 6/15/2021, 8:07:44 PM ET

Private poll (125 authorized voters)

Actual votes cast: 98

Complete results of the election, using the Schulze rules for Condorcet completion, are:

1. Eric Malm  (Condorcet winner: wins contests with all other choices)
2. David Stevenson  loses to Eric Malm by 62–22
3. Jan von Loewenstein  loses to Eric Malm by 73–22, loses to David Stevenson by 60–34
4. Stephan Merker  loses to Eric Malm by 70–25, loses to Jan von Loewenstein by 46–31
5. Beyhan Veli  loses to Eric Malm by 72–23, loses to Stephan Merker by 42–35
6. Lee Porte  loses to Eric Malm by 83–8, loses to Beyhan Veli by 48–41
7. Andrew Edgar  loses to Eric Malm by 82–10, loses to Lee Porte by 43–41
8. Daniel Vaughan  loses to Eric Malm by 90–1, loses to Andrew Edgar by 58–14

Our TOC rules for a maximum of 2 TOC members from the same employer must be applied to these results, placing Lee Porte on the TOC instead of Beyhan Veli.

Eric and David were the top two nominees of the group, meaning that both of them will have the full two year TOC member term. Jan, Stephan and Lee will each have a one year term, and their seats on the TOC will be up for election again in 2022. Keep in mind that this difference in term lengths only applies to this first election. In 2022, those three TOC seats will be elected for the standard TOC member term of two years. Of course, Jan, Stephan and Lee will be more than welcome to run in 2022.

Records of all cast ballots are available in [CSV format here](ballots.csv).

## 2022-05-17 Amendment

In the TOC meeting on May 17th, 2022, the TOC decided it would be more equitable to distribute the seats with the 2021-2023 terms evenly between the VMware and the SAP representatives. The TOC also decided to allocate the 2-year seat to Stephan Merker, since Jan von Loewenstein intends not to run for a continued position on the TOC after the 2021-2022 term.
