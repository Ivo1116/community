Nomination Statement: I have been an active member of the paketo and cloud native buildpacks community for the last 2 years. Since my involvement I have contributed to pushing forward multi-arch support both within paketo and upstream in the CNB project. I believe I bring a valuable outside perspective not only as an end-user but also as a buildpack author and operator.
