Nomination Statement: I have been active in the Cloud Foundry community (as Bosh maintainer and later founding TOC member) since 2015. I am currently a member of the Paketo Steering Committee. My team has been looking into Paketo buildpacks since around 2019 and we are regular contributors to the project.
Managing the backlog of my team, I speak a lot with buildpack users. At the same time I believe I still hold enough technical grasp to be able to translate between requirements and technical project direction.
